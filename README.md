# SYSP: Screw You Sandy Pall
Sandy Pall in a repulsive old woman who posts skimpy videos of herself to small subreddits such as r/bonehealingjuice and r/ICoveredASong which aren't highly moderated, in order to promote her YouTube channel and the erotic books she sells. (I'm not making this up, here's [a post of hers](https://www.reddit.com/r/bonehealingjuice/comments/y5ozyq/im_winning/)) 

She evades bans and blocks by creating new alts, but I refuse to give her my YouTube views, not even by accidentally clicking the embedded videos on Reddit. So, in order to spite her I wrote a script which blocks all embedded videos from her channel and replaces them with a black screen. 

If you've seen some of her posts and hate her guts as much as I do, I want to share the script with you to hopefully prevent her image from ever reaching your retinas again. 

# How to use
1. Have a userscript manager extension/plugin installed, such as Greasemonkey, [Violentmonkey](https://violentmonkey.github.io/) (the one I use) or Tampermonkey. 
2. Open [sysp.user.js](https://github.com/Sanian-Creations/SYSP/raw/main/sysp.user.js) and install the script.
