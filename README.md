# SYSP: Screw You Sandy Pall

Are you tired of Sandy Pall posting her disgusting videos all over your social media? Well worry no more! With this userscript, any videos of hers which are embedded on other pages (such as reddit) will be blocked the moment they try to load.

# How to use
1. Use Firefox. (sorry folks, this script uses a Firefox-exclusive Event called "beforescriptexecute", it won't work on other browsers)
2. Have a userscript extension installed, such as Greasemonkey, Violentmonkey or Tampermonkey.
3. Open [sysp.user.js](https://github.com/Sanian-Creations/SYSP/raw/main/sysp.user.js) and install the script.
